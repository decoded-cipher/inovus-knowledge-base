# Inovus Labs - Kristu Jyoti College's Student Innovation Hub

Inovus Labs is the official Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC) of **Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology**, Kerala.

Driven entirely by students, Inovus Labs serves as a vibrant space for experimentation, collaboration, and real-world problem-solving through technology and innovation.

We bring together passionate students from diverse disciplines to:

- Build impactful software and hardware projects

At Inovus Labs, learning doesn't stop at classrooms â€” we learn by building, failing, and growing together.
