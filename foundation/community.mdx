# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Inovus Labs Community

Inovus Labs is not just a space filled with tools and whiteboards — it’s a living, growing community of builders. From first-year students who walk in out of curiosity, to senior alumni who still contribute across the globe, the community is what makes Inovus Labs thrive.

It is not a club you join. It is a community you enter.

## 🧩 Membership Model

There’s no form to fill out. No test to pass. No qualifications required.

The only things needed to be a part of Inovus Labs are **intent to learn** and **willingness to contribute**. 

Everyone is welcome — students from any department, teaching staff, non-teaching staff, students from other institutions, and even alumni. Our lab has always remained open to people who are curious, regardless of academic background or affiliation.

New members usually walk in on a weekday, observe a build or brainstorm, and slowly start participating or attend an event. Seniors often take time to explain things informally. Those who show up repeatedly, ask questions, and start experimenting — they become the lab.

No one is *granted* membership. You grow into it by doing.

We call it **osmosis-based onboarding** — you absorb the culture by being around it.** — you absorb the culture by being around it.

## 🧠 Roles and Culture

There is no official hierarchy within the Inovus Labs student community. No titles. No chain of command. Everyone earns respect through contribution.

For the sake of institutional documentation — especially in compliance with Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) — a formal list of **office bearers** is maintained under Inovus Labs IEDC. These include roles such as Nodal Officer and a panel of student executive members. Similarly, a few members act as the campus leads for external communities like GTech Mulearn, HackClub, and TinkerHub.

These designations, however, are only for **administrative and communication purposes** — they are not emphasized or reflected within Inovus Labs' internal community. Here, **the community is the king**. Leadership is earned through trust and contribution, not titles.

## 🧓 Alumni and Ongoing Involvement

Once a part of Inovus, always a part of Inovus.

Our alumni — many now engineers, designers, researchers, or founders — still contribute to projects, mentor juniors, or help with hosting platforms. Some even spin up weekend ideas as micro-startups. Our past members are our extended strength.

## 📢 Outreach and Open Events

We don’t just build. We share.

Every year, Inovus Labs conducts:
- **School Outreach Visits** where members explain STEM fundamentals
- **Collaborative Events** with other IEDCs and innovation cells
- **Hands-On Bootcamps** on IoT, AI, design tools, and rapid prototyping

These events help spread the culture of curiosity beyond the four walls of our lab. And often, they bring in the next generation of makers.

## 🫂 What Makes This a Community

- We don’t have member counts — we have **people who care**.
- We don’t run events for claps — we run them to **pull others in**.
- We don’t restrict access — we **share what we know**.
- We don’t gatekeep tools — we **teach how to use them**.

This is not a place where you pay fees and attend meetings.
This is a place where you keep coming back, because you want to.

This is Inovus Labs.
And you are welcome.
