# üå± The Founding Story of Inovus Labs

Inovus Labs began under the **badam tree** in front of our **Geology Department** in **2015** at Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology. At the time, the college had little exposure to technical communities, and students interested in innovation had no formal support or structure. 

A few curious students ‚Äî led by **Jithin Shah** and his friends ‚Äî began gathering not to build hardware or code immediately, but to simply **build a network of like-minded people**, **learn something new together**, **explore beyond academics**, **bridge the gap between theoretical learning and real-world application**, and **experiment with innovation in any form**.

This informal circle did not start with circuits and sensors. It started with **discussions and a desire to learn**. The tree served as an open-air knowledge hub, where students brought ideas, shared resources, debated possibilities, and slowly began shaping what would become a movement.

They initially came together with a simple goal: to build a **network of students who could learn something new, explore beyond academics, bridge the gap in traditional classroom education, and carry out innovation together.** Their mission was not born out of necessity but out of passion ‚Äî a collective urge to understand technology through firsthand experience, to make learning tangible, and to innovate in a space where such ambition was uncommon.

## üèõ Becoming Official: The First IEDC Chapter

This is the year 2017. The group started procedures to start an official Startup Incubation Center to bring in a spirit of innovation and to facilitate innovative projects into potential startups. After multiple attempts and with the support of Reni Mathew (A professor from the B.Com department), we submitted the formal request to the authorities of Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM) to start an IEDC chapter at the college.

The relentless efforts finally paid off. The group received official recognition as an **IEDC (Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell)** under the Kerala Startup Mission. This marked a historic moment ‚Äî **Inovus Labs became the first IEDC approved in a non-engineering college under KSUM** and thereby became **Inovus Labs IEDC**.

The college allotted a modest, unused room tucked away behind other blocks. But to the team, it was everything. They spent weekends transforming it: painting the walls, bringing in their old equipment, setting up worktables with salvaged benches, and even installing network connections. What was once an idea beneath a tree had grown roots.

## üîÅ The Beginning of a Culture

From day one, Inovus Labs was built on the belief that everyone ‚Äî regardless of department or year ‚Äî could participate, contribute, and build. There was no official hierarchy. No one was given a leadership badge. You earned your place through action.

This culture of openness, curiosity, and iteration laid the foundation for what Inovus Labs would become. Over the years, the lab became synonymous with hands-on learning, collaborative projects, and tech-led campus transformation.

## üß≠ Legacy of the Founders

The original members ‚Äî including **Jithin Shah**, **Nithin Lalachan**, **Joseph Sabu**, and many others ‚Äî not only started a student community; they lit the spark for a self-sustaining movement. They proved that innovation was not the domain of engineers alone. They broke stereotypes, created opportunities, and built a lab that would go on to impact hundreds of students.

Their legacy lives on ‚Äî in the projects and initiatives that continue to emerge from Inovus Labs, in the weekend builds still held religiously, and in the culture of trust and autonomy that defines the lab to this day.

Inovus Labs was born under a badam tree. But it continues to grow wherever there are students willing to question, build, and learn.
