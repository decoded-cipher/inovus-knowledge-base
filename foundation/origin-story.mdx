# üå± The Founding Story of Inovus Labs

Inovus Labs began under the **badam tree** in front of the **Geology Department** in **2015** at Kristu Jyoti College of Management and Technology. At the time, the campus lacked exposure to technical communities, and students passionate about innovation had no formal support system or dedicated space for their ideas. Yet, against all odds, a quiet movement started taking shape.

A group of curious students ‚Äî led by **Jithin Shah** and his friends ‚Äî began gathering not to build hardware or code, but to **build a network of like-minded learners**. Their goal was simple but ambitious: to **explore beyond academics**, **learn collaboratively**, **bridge the disconnect between theory and real-world relevance**, and **innovate without boundaries**.

These weekend gatherings weren‚Äôt technical sessions to begin with. They were idea-circles. The badam tree served as their open-air hub ‚Äî a space where curiosity thrived, questions were encouraged, and learning was entirely peer-driven. Discussions ranged from emerging technologies to unexplored possibilities. Slowly, this informal group started evolving into something bigger.

They came together not out of academic obligation but out of passion ‚Äî driven by a shared vision to understand technology through firsthand experience, make learning hands-on and practical, and foster a spirit of innovation in a college where such ambitions were rare.

## üèõ Becoming Official: The First IEDC Chapter

Fast forward to **2017**. With growing interest and deeper intent, the group initiated formal procedures to launch an official startup incubation center on campus ‚Äî one that could catalyze student ideas into impactful projects and startups.

With the backing and mentorship of **Prof. Reni Mathew** from the B.Com department, a formal request was submitted to **Kerala Startup Mission (KSUM)** to establish an IEDC chapter. It wasn‚Äôt their first attempt, but it was the most prepared ‚Äî supported by documentation, participation data, and a clear roadmap.

Their efforts were finally rewarded. The group received official recognition as an **Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Cell (IEDC)** under KSUM. It marked a turning point ‚Äî **Inovus Labs became the first IEDC approved in a non-engineering college under KSUM**, and was henceforth known as **Inovus Labs IEDC**.

The college allocated a modest, unused room that was originally built to be a staff room ‚Äî possibly for the Psychology department. It was located in a prestigious part of the main block, on the same floor as the principal‚Äôs office and college administration. Situated on the right wing of the building‚Äôs first floor, it stood to the left when one climbed the main staircase. When it was first allotted to the team, the room was still under construction ‚Äî filled with piles of construction waste, covered in dust, and without electricity. This was around the time new members began joining the group. Jithin Chettan and his friends ‚Äî Joseph Sabu, Freddy Jetty Johnson, Vignesh Kumar, and Sandeep S ‚Äî were often seen literally sitting on top of bricks as they continued discussions and ideation.

But when the team returned after the Onam holidays, the transformation was striking. The flooring had been completed. Electricity was installed. Chairs had arrived. Two glass-top work tables stood in the center. In the following months, the room even received a dedicated internet connection and a brand-new television. What was once an idea beneath a tree had now begun to grow walls, wires, and windows ‚Äî the foundation for something far bigger. The vision born under the tree had finally taken root.

## üîÅ The Beginning of a Culture

Right from its inception, Inovus Labs was guided by a simple but powerful idea ‚Äî **everyone could contribute**. There were no official designations or titles. Hierarchies were replaced by action. Students from all departments, all years, and all backgrounds were welcomed.

What mattered was not how much you knew, but how much you were willing to learn and build. Mistakes were accepted. Experiments were encouraged. Peer-to-peer learning became the norm, and weekends transformed into dedicated time for exploration and project-building.

This inclusive and experimental culture laid the foundation for everything Inovus Labs would grow into ‚Äî a space where innovation was not an event but a habit.

## üß≠ Legacy of the Founders

The founding team ‚Äî including **Jithin Shah**, **Nithin Lalachan**, **Joseph Sabu**, and many others ‚Äî didn‚Äôt just form a community. They created a self-sustaining, ever-evolving platform for students to learn, build, and lead.

They shattered the stereotype that innovation belonged only to engineering campuses. They built opportunities from scratch, created impact beyond their batch, and showed what student-led change could look like.

Their legacy continues ‚Äî in the systems still in place, the tools still being built, and the weekend gatherings that still happen. Inovus Labs today is a dynamic force for hands-on learning and real-world problem-solving, built entirely by students, for students.

And yes, the **badam tree** still stands ‚Äî not just as a physical landmark, but as a living symbol of where it all began: with curiosity, community, and courage.
