Inovus Labs is the official student-driven innovation community of Mar Athanasius College of Engineering (MACE), Kerala.

We are a multidisciplinary collective where students from all departments collaborate to build impactful hardware, software, and community projects. From IoT systems to open-source platforms, we solve real-world problems while fostering peer learning and innovation.

Inovus Labs functions as an IEDC (Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre) and actively partners with communities like Tinkerhub, Hack Club, and GTech Mulearn.
