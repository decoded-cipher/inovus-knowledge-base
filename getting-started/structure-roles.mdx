# 🏛 Structure & Roles

Inovus Labs thrives on a flat, student-powered structure where leadership is earned through contribution, and every member has the opportunity to shape the community.

We follow a hybrid model that combines formal **IEDC guidelines** set by the Government of Kerala with our own culture of peer mentorship, self-driven projects, and democratic decision-making.
